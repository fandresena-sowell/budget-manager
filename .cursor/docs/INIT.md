## Introduction
I want to create a comprehensive Monthly Budget Manager app that helps users track, manage, and analyze their personal finances. While there are many budget apps available, I'm looking to build one that perfectly fits my needs with a clean, intuitive interface and powerful tracking features. I need your help to build this application.

## Specifications

### App presentation
We will create a full-featured hybrid app named "Monthly Budget Manager" that works across web and mobile platforms with a mobile-first approach. The app will be built using:

    * Income
    * Expenses
    * Budget
    * Reports
    * Settings
  * A main content area that adapts based on the selected section
  * Modals and drawers for detailed actions and forms

This app will provide deep integration between income tracking, expense management, and budget planning with the following core features:
- User authentication and profile management
- Income source tracking with recurring entries
- Expense tracking with receipt uploads
- Monthly budget planning by categories
- Visual reports and spending analysis
- Cloud synchronization across devices

* The source code will be organized following Quasar's directory structure:
  * src/ - Main application code
  * src/components/ - Reusable UI components
  * src/pages/ - Page components
  * src/layouts/ - Layout components
  * src/composables/ - Shared logic
  * src/boot/ - App initialization code
  * src/css/ - Global CSS/Sass files
  * src/router/ - Routing configuration
  * src/stores/ - Pinia stores for state management

* Follow the MVVM architecture pattern for clear separation of concerns
* Utilize Pinia for state management
* Leverage Quasar's built-in components for UI elements (forms, cards, lists, etc.)
* Use Quasar's responsive design capabilities with mobile-first approach
* Connect directly to Firebase services (no custom backend):
  * Firebase Authentication for user management
  * Firestore for database operations
  * Firebase Storage for receipt uploads
  * Firebase Security Rules for data protection
* Implement proper error handling and data validation
* Comprehensive unit and integration testing with Vitest
* Clean Git workflow with meaningful commits
* Use Quasar CLI to build for multiple platforms (web, PWA, mobile via Capacitor)

## Functional requirements to document and follow

* Document all API endpoints with examples
* Include user guides for key features
* Maintain a changelog for tracking version updates

## Expected output
A well-organized and detailed working plan tailored for Claude 3.7 Sonnet using the provided specifications to produce the following output:
* A well-organized `TODO.md` file stored at the root path and listing all the tasks required to build the app from Zero to Hero using Cursor IDE in conjunction with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, ensuring each task has an unique ID and is focused on a single aspect.
  * **IMPORTANT: This file must be the single source of truth for the development progress and the tasks must be doable in approximately 2-6 hours**
* For each task mentioned in the `TODO.md` file, a specific markdown task file that provides all the requirements to complete the given task:
  * Each task file will be generated using the `task-template.md` template file at the root and stored in the `tasks` folder
  * Each task file is referenced by its original task from the `TODO.md` file to facilitate tasks discovery
  * **IMPORTANT: The task files are not intended to provide fine-grained implementation details like code examples**
* A `README.md` file at the root path with:
  * A short summary of the project
  * Detailed instruction on how to:
    * Add more tasks to the `TODO.md` file
    * Create a prompt that asks Claude 3.7 Sonnet to generate the task file for a given `TODO.md` task using the task template file
  * Links to the project documentation index files
* A `CHANGELOG.md` file stored at the root path that will be incremented each time a task is completed with a summary of the changes.
  * **IMPORTANT: This file will show a clean and easy to read timeline of the changes.**
