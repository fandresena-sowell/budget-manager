# AUTH-001: Create login and registration components

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- .cursor/docs/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- README.md (For project overview and guidelines)
- .cursor/docs/INIT.md (For project specifications and authentication implementation details)
- .cursor/docs/tasks/FIRE-001.md (For Firebase authentication setup context)

## Overview
This task involves creating the user interface components for login and registration functionality in the Monthly Budget Manager application. These components will utilize the Firebase authentication service configured in FIRE-001 and provide users with a seamless authentication experience.

## Requirements
- Create a login component with email/password fields and login button
- Create a registration component with necessary fields for new user accounts
- Implement form validation for both components
- Design clean, responsive UI following the application's design patterns
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- Create navigation between login and registration views
- Implement "Forgot Password" functionality

## Init
- [x] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [x] Understand how these authentication components fit into the overall application architecture
- [x] Review the Firebase authentication service implemented in FIRE-001

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Create a login page component (src/pages/LoginPage.vue)
- [x] Implement login form with email and password fields
- [x] Add validation for the login form fields
- [x] Create a registration page component (src/pages/RegisterPage.vue)
- [x] Implement registration form with required fields (email, password, confirm password, name)
- [x] Add validation for registration form fields
- [x] Implement password strength requirements and visual feedback
- [x] Create a "Forgot Password" component or section
- [x] Implement responsive design for all components
- [x] Add loading states during authentication processes
- [x] Implement error messaging for authentication failures
- [x] Create navigation links between login and registration views
- [x] Add transition animations between views
- [x] Configure routing for authentication pages
- [x] Implement redirect logic for authenticated users

## Success Criteria
- [x] Login component allows users to successfully authenticate with email/password
- [x] Registration component allows new users to create accounts
- [x] Both forms implement proper validation with user feedback
- [x] Components are responsive and work well on mobile and desktop
- [x] Error handling provides clear feedback on authentication issues
- [x] Users can navigate between login and registration views
- [x] "Forgot Password" functionality works correctly
- [x] Authenticated users are redirected to the appropriate page
- [x] Visual design matches the application's style guide

## Dependencies
- FIRE-001: Set up Firebase project and configure authentication

## Notes
- Focus on creating a clean, intuitive user experience for the authentication flow
- Ensure proper form validation to prevent common authentication issues
- Consider implementing a "Remember Me" option for login
- Use Quasar's built-in form components and validation
- These components should only handle the UI aspects; the actual authentication logic should use the service created in FIRE-001
- Consider implementing a guest/demo mode option if appropriate for the application

## Post-process
- [x] Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- [x] Ensure code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with a summary of the changes

## Verification Checklist
- [x] All implementation steps completed
- [x] All success criteria met
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [x] Documentation updated as needed
- [x] CHANGELOG.md updated with summary of changes

## Final Steps
- [x] Mark the task as completed in .cursor/docs/TODO.md
- [x] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
