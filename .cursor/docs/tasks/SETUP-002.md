# SETUP-002: Set up project directory structure according to specifications

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- .cursor/docs/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- README.md (For project overview and guidelines)
- .cursor/docs/INIT.md (For detailed technical specifications)
- SETUP-001.md (To understand what was already set up in the initial project)

## Overview
This task focuses on establishing the proper directory structure for the Monthly Budget Manager application following Quasar Framework best practices and the project specifications. A well-organized directory structure is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and collaboration.

## Requirements
- Create all necessary directories according to Quasar Framework conventions
- Set up dedicated folders for each application feature
- Establish component organization with proper naming conventions
- Create placeholder files to maintain directory structure in Git
- Document the directory structure for future reference

## Init
- [ ] Review Quasar Framework's recommended directory structure
- [ ] Understand how the application features map to the directory structure
- [ ] Identify any special requirements from the project specifications

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create core src/ directories:
  - [ ] src/components/ - With subdirectories for each feature area (dashboard, budget, expenses, income, reports, settings)
  - [ ] src/pages/ - With dedicated page components for each main section
  - [ ] src/layouts/ - With MainLayout and AuthLayout components
  - [ ] src/composables/ - For shared logic (useAuth, useBudget, useExpenses, useIncome)
  - [ ] src/boot/ - Initialize Firebase, authentication, and other services
  - [ ] src/css/ - Global styles and theme variables
  - [ ] src/router/ - Routing configuration with route guards
  - [ ] src/stores/ - Pinia stores for state management
  - [ ] src/services/ - Firebase service wrappers and API clients
  - [ ] src/models/ - Type definitions and data models
  - [ ] src/utils/ - Utility functions and helpers
- [ ] Create test directories mirroring the src structure
  - [ ] tests/unit/ - For unit tests
  - [ ] tests/integration/ - For integration tests
- [ ] Add .gitkeep files to maintain empty directories
- [ ] Create index.js files for directory exports where appropriate
- [ ] Document the directory structure in project documentation

## Success Criteria
- All required directories and placeholder files are created
- Directory structure follows Quasar Framework conventions
- Project passes initial build without errors
- Directory structure accommodates all planned features
- Documentation clearly explains the directory organization

## Dependencies
- SETUP-001: Initialize Quasar project with proper configuration

## Notes
- Follow the technical requirements specified in .cursor/docs/INIT.md for directory organization
- Consider future scalability when establishing the structure
- Use standard naming conventions for files and directories
- Organize components by feature rather than by type for better maintainability

## Post-process
- [ ] Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- [ ] Ensure code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with a summary of the changes

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with summary of changes

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in .cursor/docs/TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
