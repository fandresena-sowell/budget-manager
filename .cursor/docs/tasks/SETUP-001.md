# SETUP-001: Initialize Quasar project with proper configuration

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- .cursor/docs/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- README.md (For project overview and guidelines)
- .cursor/docs/INIT.md (For technical specifications and requirements)

## Overview
This task involves initializing a new Quasar project with the proper configuration settings to support the Monthly Budget Manager application requirements. This is the foundational step that will set up the project structure and dependencies needed for all subsequent development tasks.

## Requirements
- Set up a new Quasar v2 project using Quasar CLI
- Configure the project to use Vue 3 and Composition API
- Install and configure Firebase SDK for web
- Configure necessary Quasar plugins and modules
- Set up proper ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Configure project for both web and mobile (Capacitor) development
- Establish the base configuration for Pinia state management

## Init
- [x] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [x] Understand how this task fits into the overall application architecture

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Install Quasar CLI globally if not already installed
- [x] Create a new Quasar project using the CLI with Vue 3 and Composition API options
- [x] Select and configure necessary Quasar plugins (Notify, Dialog, Loading, etc.)
- [x] Install Firebase SDK packages (`firebase` and related packages)
- [x] Install Pinia for state management
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- [x] Configure Quasar for Capacitor support
- [x] Update the quasar.config.js file with proper settings for the project
- [x] Create base structure for source directories (follow Quasar conventions)
- [x] Set up environment variables configuration (.env files)
- [x] Verify the project builds and runs successfully

## Success Criteria
- The Quasar project is created and runs without errors
- Firebase SDK is properly installed and configured
- ESLint and Prettier are set up with appropriate rules
- The project structure follows Quasar conventions
- Pinia store is initialized and ready to use
- Both web and mobile (Capacitor) builds work correctly
- The project includes all necessary Quasar plugins for the application

## Dependencies
None - this is the first task in the project

## Notes
- Choose Vite as the build tool over Webpack for better performance
- Make sure to follow the Firestore security rules best practices
- Consider code splitting and lazy loading for better performance
- When installing dependencies, specify versions to ensure compatibility

## Post-process
- [x] Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- [x] Ensure code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with a summary of the changes

## Verification Checklist
- [x] All implementation steps completed
- [x] All success criteria met
- [ ] ~~All tests pass~~
- [x] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [x] Documentation updated as needed
- [x] CHANGELOG.md updated with summary of changes

## Final Steps
- [x] Mark the task as completed in .cursor/docs/TODO.md
- [x] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
