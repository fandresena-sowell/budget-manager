# FIRE-001: Set up Firebase project and configure authentication

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- .cursor/docs/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- README.md (For project overview and guidelines)
- .cursor/docs/INIT.md (For project specifications and Firebase implementation details)
- SETUP-001.md (For Quasar project setup context)

## Overview
This task involves setting up a new Firebase project for the Monthly Budget Manager application and configuring Firebase Authentication to allow users to register and sign in. This is the foundation for all Firebase-related functionality in the application.

## Requirements
- Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console
- Set up the project with appropriate settings for a budget management application
- Configure Firebase Authentication with email/password provider
- Integrate Firebase SDK into the Quasar application
- Create authentication service wrapper functions
- Implement environment variables for Firebase configuration

## Init
- [x] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [x] Understand how Firebase Authentication fits into the overall application architecture

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Create a new Firebase project through the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [x] Configure project settings (name, region, Google Analytics, etc.)
- [x] Enable Authentication in the Firebase project
- [x] Configure Email/Password sign-in method
- [x] Add Firebase SDK to the Quasar project using npm packages
- [x] Create environment variables file for storing Firebase configuration securely
- [x] Create a Firebase configuration file in the project (src/boot/firebase.js)
- [x] Initialize Firebase in the application
- [x] Create Firebase authentication service wrapper (src/services/auth.ts)
- [x] Implement basic authentication methods (register, login, logout, password reset)
- [x] Set up authentication state persistence

## Success Criteria
- [x] Firebase project is created and properly configured
- [x] Firebase Authentication is enabled with email/password provider
- [x] Firebase SDK is integrated into the Quasar application
- [x] Environment variables are properly set up for Firebase configuration
- [x] Authentication service wrapper functions are implemented and ready to use
- [x] Basic authentication functions work as expected

## Dependencies
- SETUP-001: Initialize Quasar project with proper configuration
- SETUP-002: Set up project directory structure according to specifications

## Notes
- Ensure that Firebase configuration variables are not committed to version control by using environment variables
- Consider setting up different Firebase projects for development, testing, and production
- Firebase Authentication is the foundation for implementing security rules in Firestore
- This task only requires setting up email/password authentication; social providers will be implemented in AUTH-005

## Post-process
- [x] Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- [x] Ensure code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with a summary of the changes

## Verification Checklist
- [x] All implementation steps completed
- [x] All success criteria met
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [x] Documentation updated as needed
- [x] CHANGELOG.md updated with summary of changes

## Final Steps
- [x] Mark the task as completed in .cursor/docs/TODO.md
- [x] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
