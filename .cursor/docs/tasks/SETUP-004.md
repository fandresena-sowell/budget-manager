# SETUP-004: Set up testing environment with Vitest

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- .cursor/docs/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- README.md (For project overview and guidelines)
- app/package.json (For dependencies)
- app/quasar.config.ts (For Quasar configuration)

## Overview
This task involves setting up a comprehensive testing environment for the Monthly Budget Manager application using Vitest. The setup will enable unit, component, and integration testing with proper TypeScript support and Vue/Quasar integration.

## Requirements
- Set up Vitest as the primary testing framework
- Configure Vue Test Utils integration for component testing
- Set up test coverage reporting
- Create a clear test directory structure mirroring the source code
- Provide example test files for developers to reference
- Document testing practices and conventions

## Init
- [x] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [x] Understand how this task fits into the overall application architecture

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Add necessary testing dependencies to package.json
  - Vitest for the test runner
  - Vue Test Utils for component testing
  - JSDOM for browser environment emulation
  - Coverage reporting package
- [x] Create vitest.config.ts with proper configuration
  - Configure plugins for Vue and Quasar
  - Set up aliases matching the main application
  - Configure coverage reporting
- [x] Set up test directory structure following project conventions
  - Unit tests directory for component and utility tests
  - Integration tests directory for workflow tests
- [x] Create test setup file with common mocks and configurations
  - Mock browser APIs (localStorage, location)
  - Configure Vue Test Utils with Quasar components
- [x] Add test scripts to package.json
  - Standard test command
  - Watch mode for development
  - Coverage reporting command
- [x] Create example test files
  - Basic utility function test
  - Vue component test with props and events
- [x] Document testing practices in app/docs/TESTING.md
  - Directory structure
  - Naming conventions
  - Example test patterns
  - Mocking strategies
  - Available commands

## Success Criteria
- [x] Running `npm run test` successfully executes tests
- [x] Component tests can mount Vue components with Quasar support
- [x] Coverage reporting works correctly
- [x] Directory structure is properly set up and follows project conventions
- [x] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [x] Example tests demonstrate best practices

## Dependencies
- SETUP-001: Initialize Quasar project with proper configuration
- SETUP-002: Set up project directory structure according to specifications
- SETUP-003: Configure linting and code formatting standards

## Notes
- The testing environment should be configured to work seamlessly with the existing ESLint and Prettier setup
- Tests should be compatible with both the development and CI environments
- The approach uses Vitest due to its fast performance, native ESM support, and compatibility with Vue and Vite
- Testing TypeScript support is critical due to the project's heavy use of types

## Post-process
- [x] Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- [x] Ensure code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [x] Update TODO.md to mark the task as completed

## Verification Checklist
- [x] All implementation steps completed
- [x] All success criteria met
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [x] Documentation updated as needed
- [x] TODO.md updated to mark task as completed

## Final Steps
- [x] Mark the task as completed in .cursor/docs/TODO.md
- [x] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
