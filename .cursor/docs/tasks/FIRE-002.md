# FIRE-002: Implement Firestore database structure and security rules

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- .cursor/docs/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- README.md (For project overview and guidelines)
- .cursor/docs/INIT.md (For project specifications and Firestore implementation details)
- .cursor/docs/tasks/FIRE-001.md (For Firebase setup and authentication context)
- .cursor/docs/tasks/SETUP-002.md (For project directory structure)

## Overview
This task focuses on designing and implementing the Firestore database structure for the Monthly Budget Manager application and setting up appropriate security rules to protect user data. The database structure will support all core features including user profiles, income sources, expenses, budget categories, and settings.

## Requirements
- Design a comprehensive Firestore database schema for all application entities
- Implement collections and document structures according to best practices
- Create appropriate indexes for efficient querying
- Implement Firestore security rules to protect user data
- Test the database structure with sample data
- Document the database schema for future reference

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand how Firestore database structure fits into the overall application architecture
- [ ] Review Firebase Authentication implementation from FIRE-001

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Design the Firestore database schema for the following collections:
  - [ ] users - User profiles and preferences
  - [ ] incomes - Income sources and transactions
  - [ ] expenses - Expense transactions with categories
  - [ ] categories - Budget categories and subcategories
  - [ ] budgets - Monthly budget allocations by category
- [ ] Create the database structure in Firebase console
- [ ] Implement proper document ID strategies for each collection
- [ ] Define relationships between collections (e.g., user to expenses)
- [ ] Set up composite indexes for complex queries
- [ ] Implement Firestore security rules with the following permissions:
  - [ ] Users can only read/write their own data
  - [ ] Authentication is required for all operations
  - [ ] Data validation rules for all document fields
- [ ] Create Firestore data models in the application (src/models/)
- [ ] Implement Firestore service wrappers (src/services/firestore.ts)
- [ ] Add basic CRUD operations for each collection
- [ ] Test database operations and security rules
- [ ] Optimize query patterns for common operations

## Success Criteria
- Firestore database structure is properly implemented and follows best practices
- Security rules effectively protect user data from unauthorized access
- Database structure supports all required application features
- Query operations are efficient and properly indexed
- Data models accurately represent the database schema
- Service wrappers provide clean interfaces for database operations
- All security rules pass testing and validation

## Dependencies
- FIRE-001: Set up Firebase project and configure authentication
- SETUP-002: Set up project directory structure according to specifications

## Notes
- Use subcollections for data that belongs exclusively to a parent document
- Consider using denormalization for frequently accessed data to reduce reads
- Design collections with scalability and query patterns in mind
- Structure security rules to be maintainable and understandable
- Test security rules thoroughly to ensure proper access control
- Consider field-level security for sensitive data
- Remember that Firestore has maximum document size of 1MB
- Use batch operations for related updates to maintain data consistency

## Post-process
- [ ] Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- [ ] Ensure code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with a summary of the changes

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with summary of changes

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in .cursor/docs/TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
